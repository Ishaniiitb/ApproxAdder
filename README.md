# Design and Analysis of an Approximate Adder with Hybrid Error Reduction

This project implements a **16-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)** using Verilog HDL. The design is part of a study into **approximate computing** for improving performance, power, and area efficiency in digital arithmetic circuits.

The above project is a VLSI design project which involved working on transistor 
level technology and approximation computing in order to perform a comparative 
study of different kinds of approximate adder circuits. Furthermore, we try 
designing and implementing an approximate adder in an attempt to outperform other
approximate adders mentioned in the project.

This project presents the implementation and analysis of an energy-efficient approximate 
adder with a hybrid error reduction scheme. Extensive comparisons highlight its superior 
performance, making it a competitive solution for error-tolerant applications.
